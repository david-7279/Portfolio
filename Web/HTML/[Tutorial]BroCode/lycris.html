        She'd take the world off my shoulders
        If it was ever hard to move
        She'd turn the rain to a rainbow
        When I was living in the blue
        Why then, if she is so perfect
        Do I still wish that it was you?
        Perfect don't mean that it's working
        So what can I do? (Ooh)

        When you're out of sight
        In my mind

        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us
        And I try to fall for her touch
        But I'm thinking of the way it was
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on
        I'm only here passing time in her arms
        Hoping I'll find
        A glimpse of us

        Tell me he savors your glory
        Does he laugh the way I did?
        Is this a part of your story?
        One that I had never lived
        Maybe one day you'll feel lonely
        And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse
        Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
        And find me again

        When you're out of sight
        In my mind

        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us
        And I try to fall for her touch
        But I'm thinking of the way it was
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on
        I'm only here passing time in her arms
        Hoping I'll find
        A glimpse of us

        Ooh, ooh-ooh
        Ooh, ooh-ooh
        Ooh, ooh, ooh

        'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us
        And I try to fall for her touch
        But I'm thinking of the way it was
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on
        I'm only here passing time in her arms
        Hoping I'll find
        A glimpse of us
